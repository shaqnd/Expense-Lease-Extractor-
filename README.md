# Master Property Database — Lease & Income/Expense Extract

`Master_Property_Database.xlsx` consolidates lease, income/expense, and valuation data
extracted and cleaned from the source documents (scanned PDFs, text PDFs, a DOCX appraisal,
and XLSX financials). All subject properties are in **Adams County, Colorado**.

A reusable Claude Code skill, **`.claude/skills/property-doc-extract`**, captures the
extraction workflow so future document batches can be parsed and merged in quickly.

## Workbook Tabs

1. **Source Documents** – index of the source files and compilation notes.
2. **Property Master** – one row per property: IDs, parcel, address, owner, assessee, type, tenancy, site/GBA/NRA, year built, land:bldg, occupancy, valuation summary.
3. **Tenants & Leases** – actual rent rolls (125 Bridge St: 11 tenants w/ rent, term, CAM; 5970 Marion units) plus proforma lease assumptions used in the tax appeals.
4. **Assessments & Valuation** – assessed/county values, prior-year values, and income-approach proformas (PGI→NOI→value).
5. **Income-Expense Summary** – total income / expense / net by property and year.
6. **Income-Expense Detail** – full line-item detail; totals use live `=SUM` formulas that match the printed totals.
7. **Sales Comparables** – warehouse sale comps supporting the R0169133 appraisal.
8. **Related Parcels** – North Side Gardens LLC 4-parcel portfolio co-listed with 7205 Gilpin Way.

## Notes

- Total / net-income / average cells are live spreadsheet formulas (`SUM`, `AVERAGE`,
  subtraction); each was verified in Python to equal the source-document printed total to the
  cent. They populate on open in Excel/Google Sheets. (LibreOffice cannot cold-start in the
  build sandbox, so the automated recalc pass is skipped in favor of Python verification.)
- **5650 Washington St** (appraisal DOCX): the rent-roll grid, income proforma, and final
  concluded value are embedded as **EMF vector images** and could not be extracted as text; the
  narrative figures (rent range, vacancy 7%, OpEx $7.17/sf ≈ 47.1% EGI, adjusted comp range
  $115.46–$134.48/sf) are captured. The concluded value is in the appraisal images.
- "in house" on the TempTee survey = owner self-performs the service, entered as `$0`.
- 5970 Marion and Broadview expense totals include financing/depreciation, so they are cash-flow /
  tax figures, not NOI. See the Assessments & Valuation tab for stabilized-NOI proformas.
- R0169133's cover value ($3,408,546) differs from its schedule total ($3,114,815); both are
  reproduced as printed.
